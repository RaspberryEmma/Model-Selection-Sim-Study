# Model-Selection-Sim-Study

Simulation study of various variable selection techniques.  Intended to examine the bias in parameter estimation in the context of causal health.  In particular, we grapple with confounding, unseen confounding and bias amplification.

The folders "data" and "plots" contain pre-computed results, such as recorded coefficient values and bias measurements.

The simulation itself can be run in one of two ways:
 - In R / RStudio, using the R script "Run_Sim.R"
 - In Jupyter via the R kernel, using the Jupyter notebook "Run_Sim.ipynb"

Still in development!
