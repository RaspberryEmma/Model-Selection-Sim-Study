# Model-Selection-Sim-Study

Simulation study of various variable selection techniques.  Intended to examine the bias in parameter estimation in the context of causal health.  In particular, we grapple with confounding, unseen confounding and bias amplification.

The folders "data" and "plots" contain pre-computed results.

The simulation can be run from command line using the bash scripts "RUN_SIM.sh" and "RUN_RESULTS_ONLY.sh".

Still in development!
